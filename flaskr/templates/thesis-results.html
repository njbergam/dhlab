    <h4> Your work, colored by parts of speech: </h4> <br>


    <p> <b> How this can help you: </b> Splitting your writing by parts of speech in this sort of hyper-visual manner
    can allow you to quickly notice patterns in your writing. What are the tones of your adjectives?
    What nouns stand out from the rest? Do your pronouns have clear antecedents? How heavy is your writing on descriptors?
    As always with these sorts of tools, there isn't some obvious correct answer––we are merely providing you
    with an objective lens, a new perspective, to see your writing.</p>

    <h4> Readability Metrics </h4>
    <p> The following information reports on the different
    parts of your essay in terms of readability. Make no mistake, the
    idea of readability and the complexity of writing is highly subjective; nevertheless, there have been indices established in
    order to give an objective idea of how 'sophisticated' a certain piece of
    writing might be, based on the lengths of words and sentences.  </p>

    <p> <b> How this can help you: </b> Compare the readability between these parts of your essay.
    If one part has an abnormal score, try to find out why, and ask yourself is this a stylistic
    choice or perhaps an inconsistency of tone in your essay.  </p>



    <br>

    <h5> Flesch Reading Ease </h5>
    <p> <b> Formula: </b> 206.83 - 1.015(avg_sentence_length) - 84.6(avg_syllable_count) </p>
    <p> Higher scores indicate text is easier to read. Designed to be a 0-100 scale, where
    100 to 70 is middle school level, 70 to 50 is high school level, 50 to 30 is undergrad,
    and 30 to 0 is graduate level. Negative scores are possible.</p>

    <br>

    <h5> Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level </h5>
    <p> <b> Formula: </b>0.39(avg_sentence_length) + 11.8(avg_syllable_count) - 15.59  </p>
    <p> Meant to present a score in terms of a US grade level, 0-12. Can also be seen
    as the number of years of education needed to understand a text.</p>

    <br>

    <h5> Gunning-Fog Index </h5>
    <p> <b> Formula: </b> 0.4(avg_sentence_length + percent_hard_words)
      <br><br>Like Flesch-Kincaid, models number of years of education/grade level needed to understand a text.
      <br> *Hard words are defined as words that are greater than three syllables and are
  neither proper nouns, the combination of simpler words, nor 2 syllable words that are extended syllabically
by -es or -ed.*</p>
