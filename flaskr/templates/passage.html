  <h1> Passage Sampling </h1>
  <p> This method is meant to allow you to sample passages of your text by certain keywords and themes.
   This is also good for randomly sampling a character and the contexts in which their name shows up.
 Play around and brainstorm!<p>


   <div class = "div2">
     {% include '/includes/_upload.html' %}
   </div>


  <form action = '/passage-results' method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>



  <br> <h5> Please enter your keyword/n-gram: </h5>
  <input type="input" class = "long" name="term" placeholder = "Put words to be examined, separated by commas" style ="width = 100%" id = "wordProgWords">

  <br><br><h5> Number of Samples: </h5>
  <input type="input" class = "long" name="numSamp" placeholder = "Number of samples" style ="width = 100%" id = "wordProgWords">

  <br><br><h5> Word Count of Samples: </h5>
  <input type="input" class = "long" name="wordCount" placeholder = "Word count of samples" style ="width = 100%" id = "wordProgWords">

  <br><br><h5> First Page of Novel: </h5>
  <input type="input" class = "long" name="firstpage" placeholder = "What page is the first line of the novel?" style ="width = 50%" id = "wordProgWords">

  * Note: The last two questions allow us to give you an approximation of <br> where each passage is in your edition of the novel.
