          <p class="card-text">
            Literature creates a certain experience, which can mirror reality or generate something new. We are interested in better understanding that transfer of experience, or, in more philosophical terms, the mechanics of literary epistemology. We discuss how fiction positions itself as a form of knowledge, what it represents, and what tensions exist between it and the historical and artistic. Modernist literature has been particularly fruitful ground for our investigation, and we have used both creative and analytical modes of writing to express our thoughts.

          <p class="card-text">
            According to the literary framework of ‘altruistic punishment,’ humans read
          literature because of an inherent desire to punish wrongdoing – a society of
          ‘cooperators’ relies on ‘punishers’ to fend off ‘defectors’ that endanger the
          beneficial trust of society. This study investigates the association between
          children's guided creative writing and their performance in the economic game
          theory experiment known as the ultimatum game to determine how the altruistic
          punishment framework can be applied to their understanding of literature.

          <p class="card-text">
            What makes a research paper great, in form and/or substance? How do new ideas enter the “canon” of computer science? How does one obtain immortality in the names of algorithms and theorems? These are the humanistic questions we ask in this unit. We approach groundbreaking computer science ideas related to industry, cryptography, and theory through their original publications, rather than polished, second-hand explanations. We will read and discuss landmark papers with an eye for both raw content and expository style. In essence, we will treat computer science research literature as literature, worth analyzing for aesthetic and historical reasons.
